Macunaimas are a magnetic toy targeted to kids, youngs and adults. It expresses
cultural and ethnic diversity through the collection of characters.

Developed by the designer Juliana Lisboa in 2011, the project was born from the
desire to transform the representation of people and their different forms of
beauty into toys.

From this desire a set of magnetic modular kits with many pieces - clothes and
accessories - that you could modify and exchange.

Themes like nudity and empowering of the woman, gender diversity, urban black culture,
bikeactivism and others were the main focus of the collection I helped to develop
the website in 2016.

Macunaimãs joined the [Prêmio Movimento HotSpot](http://movimentohotspot.com/) in 2014 on the category
Illustration and have been displayed in many creative economy fairs around Brasil.
